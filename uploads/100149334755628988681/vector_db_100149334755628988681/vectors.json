[{"text":"Scope Resolution Operator (::)\n• Defining member functions outside the class\n• Tells the compiler which scope (class, namespace, or global) a function/variable belongs to.\n• To separate interface (in header) from implementation (in .cpp), we use\n::to show which class the\nfunction belongs to.\n• // In number.h\nclass Number {\npublic:\nint factorial(int n);\n};\n29-08-2025CS2000: Object Oriented Programming1\n\nScope Resolution Operator\n// In number.cpp\n#include \"number.h\"\nint Number::factorial(int n) { // <- scope resolution operator\nint fact = 1;\nfor(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) fact *= i;\nreturn fact;\n}\n• Here, Number::factorial means “This factorial function belongs to the Number class.”\n29-08-2025CS2000: Object Oriented Programming2\n\nScope Resolution

classes, and variables together.\n• Here, square() belongs to the namespace Math.\n• To access it from outside, we use :: (scope resolution).\n\nAccess Modifiers\n• publicelements can be accessed by all other classes and functions.\n• privateelements cannot be accessed outside the class in which they are declared, except\nby friend classes and functions.\n• protectedelements are just like the private, except they can be accessed by derived\nclasses.\n• By default, class members in C++ are private, unless specified otherwise.\n29-08-2025CS2000 - Object Oriented Programming5\nSpecifiersSame

A constructor is a ‘special’ member function whose task is to initialize the objects of its class. It is\nspecial because\nits name is the same as the class name.\n• The constructor is invoked whenever an object of its associated class is created.\n• It is called a constructor\nbecause it constructs the values of data members of the class.\n• In C++, a constructor has the same name as theclass, and it does not have a return type.\n• Example:\n• Here, the function Wall() is a constructor of the class Wall. The constructor;\n• has the same name as the class\n• does not have a return type, and\n• is public\n29-08-2025CS2000 - Object Oriented Programming6\nclassWall{\npublic:\n// create a constructor\nWall() {\n// code\n}\n};\n\nConstructors\n• A constructor is declared and defined as follows:\n// class with a constructor\nclass Integer {\nint m, n;\npublic:\nInteger(void);\n// constructor declared\n......\n......\n};\nInteger :: Integer(void)\n// constructor definition\n{\nm = 0;\nn = 0;\n}\n29-08-2025CS2000 - Object Oriented Programming7\n\nConstructors: Characteristics\n•The constructor functions have some special characteristics. These\nare:\n• They should be declared in the public section.\n• They are invoked automatically when the objects are created.\n• They do not have return types, not even void, and therefore, they cannot\nreturn values.\n• Like other C++ functions, they can have default arguments.\n29-08-2025CS2000 - Object Oriented Programming8\n\nDefault Constructor\n• A constructor that accepts no parameters is called thedefault constructor.\n• The default constructor for class A is\nA :: A()\n• If no such constructor is defined, then the compiler supplies a default\nconstructor.\n• Therefore, a statement

For example,\n29-08-2025CS2000 - Object Oriented Programming10\n// C++ program to demonstrate the use of default constructor\n#include<iostream>\nusing namespacestd;\n// declare a class\nclassWall{\nprivate:\ndoublelength;\npublic:\n// default constructor to initialize variable\nWall()\n: length{\n5.5} {\ncout<<\"Creating a wall.\"<<endl;\ncout<<\"Length = \"<< length <<endl;\n}\n};\nintmain() {\nWall wall1;\nreturn0;\n}\n\nParameterized Constructors\n• The constructorInteger()initializes the data members of all the objects to zero.\n• However, in practice, it may be necessary to initialize the various data elements\nof different objects with different values when they are created.\n• C++ permits us to achieve this objective\nby passing arguments to the constructor\nfunction\nwhen the objects are created.\n• The constructors\nthat can take argumentsare calledparameterized constructors.\n29-08-2025CS2000 - Object Oriented Programming11\n\nParameterized Constructors\n• The constructor Integer() may be modified to take arguments as shown below:\nclass Integer\n{\nint m, n;\npublic:\nInteger(int x, int y);    // parameterized constructor\n.....\n.....\n};\nInteger :: Integer(int x, int y)\n{\nm = x; n = y;\n}\n• When a constructor has been parameterized, the object declaration statement, such as\nInteger int1;// may not work.\n29-08-2025CS2000 - Object Oriented Programming12\n\nParameterized Constructors\n• We must pass the initial values as arguments to the constructor function when an object is\ndeclared. This can be done in two ways:\n• By calling the constructor explicitly.\nInteger int1 = Integer(0, 100);   // explicit call\n• By calling the constructor implicitly.\nInteger int1(0, 100);// implicit call\n• Note:When the constructor is parameterized, we must provide appropriate arguments for the\nconstructor.\n29-08-2025CS2000 - Object Oriented

2\nInteger(Integer & i)// constructor 3\n{m = i.m; n = i.n; }\n};\n29-08-2025CS2000 - Object Oriented Programming22\n• C++ permits us to use more than one constructor in the same class.\n• When more than one constructor function is defined in a class, we say that the constructor is overloaded.\n\nfriend Function and friend Classes\n• Data hiding is a fundamental concept of object-oriented programming. It restricts the access of private\nmembers from outside of the class.\n• Similarly, protected members can only be accessed by derived classes and are inaccessible from\noutside. For example,\nclass\nMyClass{\nprivate:\nint member1;\n}\nint main() {\nMyClass obj;\n// Error! Cannot access private members from here.\nobj.member1 = 5;\n}\n• However, there is a feature in C++ called\nfriend functionsthat breaks this rule and allows us to access\nmember functions from outside

For example,\nclass ClassB;\nclass ClassA {\n// ClassB is a friend class of ClassA\nfriend class ClassB;\n... .. ...\n}\nclass ClassB {\n... .. ...\n}\n• When a class is declared as a friend class, all the member functions of the friend class become friend\nfunctions.\n• Since ClassB is a friend class, we can access all members of ClassA from inside ClassB.\n• However, we cannot access members of ClassB from inside ClassA. It is because friend relation in C++ is\nonly granted, not taken.\n29-08-2025CS2000 - Object Oriented Programming26\n\nfriend Class\n29-08-2025CS2000 - Object Oriented Programming27\n\nfriend Class\n29-08-2025CS2000 - Object Oriented Programming28\nOutput:\n\nOverloaded Constructors\n29-08-2025CS2000 - Object Oriented Programming29\nComplex.h\n•The first time the preprocessor sees #ifndef COMPLEX_H, it finds that COMPLEX_H is not defined → it\ndefines it and includes the file.\n•The second time, since COMPLEX_H is already defined, the header is skipped.\n•So the compiler sees the class

constructor\nA::A(int=0).\n• The default argument constructor can be called with either one argument or no arguments.\nWhen called with no arguments, it becomes a default constructor.\n• When both these forms are used together in a class, it causes ambiguity for a statement such\nas\nA a;\n• The ambiguity is whether to ‘call’ A::A() or A::A(int=0).

That is, the initial value of an object\nmay be provided during run time.\n• One advantage of dynamic initialization is that we can provide various\ninitialization formats, using overloaded constructors.\n• Consider the long-term deposit schemes working in the commercial banks. The\nbanks provide different interest rates for different schemes as well as for\ndifferent periods of investment.\n29-08-2025CS2000 - Object Oriented Programming33\n\n29-08-2025CS2000 - Object Oriented Programming34\n• The program illustrates how to use the class variables for holding account details and\nhow to construct these variables at run time using dynamic initialization.\nDynamic

This is how the contents of the\nobject are copied.\n• In main(), we then create two objects\nwall1 and wall2and then copy the contents of\nwall1 to wall2:\n• // copy contents of wall1 to wall2\nWall wall2 = wall1;\n• Here, the wall2 object calls its copy constructor by passing the reference of the wall1\nobject as its argument.\n29-08-2025CS2000 - Object Oriented Programming41\n\nCopy Constructor\n29-08-2025CS2000 - Object Oriented Programming42\ncode.cpp\nCode.h\n\nCopy Constructor\n29-08-2025CS2000 - Object Oriented Programming43\nOutput:\nMain.cpp\n• A reference variable has been used as an argument to the copy constructor. We cannot pass the argument by\nvalue to a copy constructor.\n\nDynamic Constructors\n• In cases like strings, arrays, or matrices, different objects may need different\namounts of memory.\n• The constructors can also be called to\nallocate memory while creating objects.\n• This will enable the system toallocate the right amount of memory for each\nobject\nwhen the objects are not of the same size, thus resulting in the saving of\nmemory.\n• Allocation of memory to\nobjects at the time of their construction is known as\ndynamic construction of objects\n.\n• The memory is allocated with the help of the\nnewoperator.\n29-08-2025CS2000 - Object Oriented Programming44\n\nDynamic Constructors\n29-08-2025CS2000 - Object Oriented

is Stack Memory?\n29-08-2025CS2000 - Object Oriented Programming52\n• Automatically managed memory: allocated when a function is called, freed when it returns.\n• Stores:\n• Local variables (int x, y;)\n• Function parameters (main(int argc, char* argv[]))\n• Return addresses (where to go back after a function call)\n• Objects created without new\n• Fast allocation and deallocation (just moves the stack pointer).\n• Limited size (a few MBs, depending on OS).\n• Scope-bound: memory is released automatically when a variable goes out of scope.\n• No need for delete — compiler manages it.\n\nWhat is Heap Memory?\n29-08-2025CS2000 - Object Oriented Programming53\n• Manually managed memory:allocated with new,freed with delete.\n• Stores:\n• Objects and arrays you explicitly allocate at runtime.\n• Used when you need memory that persists beyond a function call.\n• Controlled by a programmer (or smart pointers in modern C++).\n• Flexible size (much larger than stack, limited by system RAM).\n• Slower allocation than stack (because the OS has to find free space).\n• Must be freed explicitly using delete or delete[].\n• Memory leaks if you forget to release it.\n\nConst OBJECTS\n• We can create X as a constant object of the class matrix as follows:\nconst matrix X(m, n); // object X is constant\n• Any attempt to modify the values of m and n will generate a compile-time error.\nFurther, a constant object can call only const member functions.\n• Whenever const objects try to invoke non-const member functions, the compiler\ngenerates errors.\n29-08-2025CS2000 - Object Oriented

the already existing objects,\nbut instead of copying the object in the new memory,\nit makes use of move semantics to\ntransfer the ownership of the already created object to the new object without creating\nextra copies.\n• It can be seen as stealing the resources from other objects.\n• The move constructor uses std::move() to transfer ownership of resources and it is called\nwhen a temporary object is passed or returned by value.\n• Syntax:\nclassName (className&& obj) {\n// body of the constructor\n}\n29-08-2025CS2000 - Object Oriented Programming55\n\nMove\nConstructor\n29-08-2025CS2000 - Object Oriented Programming56\n• MyClass constructor takes an rvalue\nreference (int &&a) and moves the\nvalue of a into the private member\nb using std::move.\n• The main function creates an integer\na, and then moves it into obj1 by\ncalling the move constructor.\n• The   move   constructor   takes\nthe\nrvalue referenceof the object of\nthe same class and transfers the\nownership of this object to the newly\ncreated object.\n• Like a copy constructor, the compiler\nwill create a move constructor for\neach class that does not have any\nexplicit move constructor.\nOutput:\n\nDestructors\n• A destructor, as the name implies, is used todestroy the objects that have been\ncreated by a constructor.\n• Like a constructor, the destructor is a member function whosename is the same\nas the class name\nbut is preceded by atilde.\n• A destructor\nnever takes any arguments,nor does it return any value.\n• It will be invoked implicitly by the compiler

Similarly, as the\nprogram control leaves the current block, the objects in the block start getting\ndestroyed, and the destructors are called for each one of them.\n• The objects are destroyed in the\nreverse order of their creation.\n• Finally, when the main block is exited, destructors are called corresponding to\nthe remaining objects present inside the main.\n29-08-2025CS2000 - Object
