      "question": "What is the relationship between distance and displacement?",
      "options": [
        "Distance is always less than or equal to displacement.",
        "Distance is always greater than or equal to displacement.",
        "Distance is always equal to displacement.",
        "Distance can be greater than, less than, or equal to displacement depending on the path."
      ],
      "answer": "Distance is always greater than or equal to displacement.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "explanation": "Displacement is the shortest distance between two points, while distance is the actual path traveled. The actual path can be longer than the shortest distance."

      "question": "When a particle moves in a circle with angular displacement θ, what is the formula for displacement?",
      "options": [
        "rθ",
        "2r sin(θ/2)",
        "2πr",
        "r cos(θ)"
      ],
      "answer": "2r sin(θ/2)",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "explanation": "When a particle moves along a circular path and covers an angle θ, its displacement is given by 2r sin(θ/2), where r is the radius of the circle."

      "question": "A car travels the first half of a journey at a speed of v1 and the second half at a speed of v2. What is the average speed for the entire journey?",
      "options": [
        "(v1 + v2) / 2",
        "√(v1 * v2)",
        "2v1v2 / (v1 + v2)",
        "(v1v2) / (v1 + v2)"
      ],
      "answer": "2v1v2 / (v1 + v2)",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "explanation": "When a body covers equal distances with different speeds, the average speed is given by the harmonic mean: 2v1v2 / (v1 + v2)."

      "question": "What does the slope of a displacement-time graph represent?",
      "options": [
        "Acceleration",
        "Velocity",
        "Force",
        "Kinetic Energy"
      ],
      "answer": "Velocity",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "explanation": "The slope of a displacement-time graph is the rate of change of displacement with respect to time, which is the definition of velocity."

      "question": "What is the physical meaning of the area under a velocity-time graph?",

        "Acceleration",
        "Displacement",
        "Force",
        "Impulse"
      ],
      "answer": "Displacement",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "explanation": "The area under the velocity-time graph represents the integral of velocity with respect to time, which gives the displacement of the object."
