        "θ = L * R",
        "L = R / θ",

      "answer": "L = R * θ",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "explanation": "The arc length (L) of a circle is equal to the radius (R) multiplied by the angle in radians (θ)."

      "question": "When an object moves along the circumference of a circle by an angle θ (in radians), what is the formula for the displacement?",
      "options": [
        "R * θ",

      "answer": "2 * R * sin(θ/2)",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "explanation": "The displacement is the straight-line distance between the initial and final points, which is given by 2 * R * sin(θ/2) in a circle."

      "options": [
        "n / (V1 + V2 + ... + Vn)",
        "(V1 + V2 + ... + Vn) / n",

      "answer": "n / (1/V1 + 1/V2 + ... + 1/Vn)",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "explanation": "Average speed is calculated by dividing total distance by total time. For 'n' equal distances, this simplifies to n / (1/V1 + 1/V2 + ... + 1/Vn)."
